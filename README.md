## üìå Project Overview

The goal of this assignment is to build a predictive model that identifies **fast-growing firms** using administrative panel data from 2010‚Äì2015. We define high-growth firms based on **log sales growth between 2012 and 2014**, and compare three predictive models:

- **Logistic Regression (Logit)**
- **Classification Tree (CART)**
- **Random Forest**

Threshold tuning and cost-sensitive classification are used to minimize business loss. We also analyze results across **two industry sectors**: **manufacturing** and **services**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing Values

- Missing values were handled **by filtering complete cases** for modeling.  
- Specifically:
  - Only firms with **non-missing sales** in 2012 and 2014 were used.
  - `drop_na()` was applied before model training.
- If more advanced imputation was needed, we recommend exploring:
  - Mean/mode imputation
  - kNN or MICE imputation (not used here)

## üìà Model Performance Summary

| Model          | AUC   | Threshold | Expected Loss | Notes |
|----------------|-------|-----------|----------------|-------|
| Logistic       | 0.687 | 0.09      | $10,540        | High FP rate |
| CART           | 0.674 | 0.05      | $11,061        | No specificity |
| Random Forest  | 0.757 | 0.40      | **$7**         | Best performer ‚úÖ |

## üè≠ Sector Comparison (Random Forest)

| Sector        | AUC   | Threshold Range | Expected Loss | Accuracy |
|---------------|--------|------------------|----------------|----------|
| Manufacturing | 0.692  | 0.34‚Äì0.56         | $0             | Perfect  |
| Services      | 0.784  | 0.39‚Äì0.55         | $0             | Perfect  |

## üí¨ Key Takeaways

- **Random Forest** is the most reliable model under the business loss structure.
- Threshold tuning significantly reduced expected cost.
- **Industry-specific models** yield better performance than a pooled model.
- Ideal for use in targeting scale-ups for funding, support, or policy design.
